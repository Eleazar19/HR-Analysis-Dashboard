## Key Insights:

- Employees who are highly educated earn more in terms of monthly salary in the company compared to employees who are less educated; in other words, the higher your educational level, the more salary you earn at the company.

- The managerial position in every department is paid way higher than any other employee.

- Salary increments for employees do not actually reflect better performance.

- The Laboratory Technician role under the Research & Development department experienced the highest number of attrited employees (62). 

- Ninety percent of employees who attained level five in educational qualification who occupied roles like Manufacturing Director, Human Resource, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist attrited from the company owing to not being satisfied with their job.

- The organization is made up of a young workforce which emanates from the young age group of unattired employees.



### Pattern:
Employees who received a 20-25% salary increase have a work performance of 4% while employees who received 11-19% in salary increase maintained 3% in work performance.


## Recommendations:

- Knowing that salary increments do not hamper the job performance of employees, the company should invest in non-monetary motivators such as career development programs, recognition systems, and work-life balance initiatives. Reason being that many employees value growth opportunities (training, mentorship, promotions) more than just money.   Recognition & appreciation (employee awards, shoutouts, peer recognition) can boost morale and engagement.

- Instead of relying heavily on salary increments, 

- A survey should be carried out to find out the reason behind the large number of attritions witnessed in the laboratory Technician role.

- Role Redesign and Enrichment: Conduct role-specific feedback sessions and job satisfaction surveys to identify dissatisfaction drivers, then restructure job roles to increase autonomy, purpose, and growth potential.

- The young workforce in the company should be maintained to have a high level of productivity within the company.
